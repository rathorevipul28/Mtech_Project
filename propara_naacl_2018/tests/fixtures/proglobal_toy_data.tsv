sediment transport be the movement of solid particle -lrb- sediment -rrb- . the movement be due to a combination of gravity act on the sediment , and/or the movement of the fluid in which the sediment be entrain . sediment transport occur in natural system where the particle be clastic rock -lrb- sand , gravel , boulder , etc. -rrb- , mud , or clay . the fluid be air , water , or ice . and the force of gravity act to move the particle along the sloping surface on which they be rest . sediment transport due to fluid motion occur in river , ocean , lake , sea , and other body of water due to current and tide . transport be also cause by glacier as they flow .
